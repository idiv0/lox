Programming languages are not regular languages because they require context. A regular language must be context-free (as well as other properties).
From chapter 5: Non-regular languages allow for grammars to be defined with recursive rules that are expressed a number of times. 
Regular languages allow for repetition, but cannot keep track of how many times the repetition has occured. Context-free grammars can.

C - Accidental token paste?
Ruby something about gsub and something about multi line comments.
CoffeeScript CBA

3) 
    Documentation from comments.
    Code analysis hints or warning add/remove.


4) 
    Allowing for nested /* */ style comments would be more complicated because the comment itself would have to be parsed, rather than ignored.
    Would also need to keep a track of the number of times that /* was entered and then */ was exited.
